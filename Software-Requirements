## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

The purpose of this project is to develop a system capable of **detecting AI-generated images** and providing **interpretations using Explainable AI (XAI)**. The system will classify images as **real or AI-generated** and generate **visual explanations** for each decision, ensuring transparency, trust, and usability.

### 1.2 Scope

* Detect synthetic images created by GANs and diffusion models.
* Provide **visual heatmaps** and **feature attributions** for predictions.
* Support research in **deepfake detection, misinformation control, and digital forensics**.
* Be modular, scalable, and extensible for academic and industrial use.

## 2. Functional Requirements

1. **Image Classification**

   * Input: An image (JPG/PNG).
   * Output: Probability score (Real vs AI-Generated).

2. **Explainability**

   * Generate **heatmaps** (Grad-CAM) for CNN/Transformer models.
   * Provide **feature importance** (SHAP, LIME).

3. **Visualization Dashboard**

   * Show predictions with explanations.
   * Compare **original vs highlighted** regions.

4. **Data Handling**

   * Load and preprocess datasets (CelebA, ImageNet, StyleGAN, Stable Diffusion).
   * Perform data augmentation.

5. **Model Training & Evaluation**

   * Support CNN and Transformer architectures.
   * Evaluate using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC.

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements

* **Performance**: The classifier should achieve **≥90% accuracy** on test datasets.
* **Scalability**: Able to train on larger datasets with transfer learning.
* **Usability**: Provide **intuitive visualization** for end-users.
* **Security**: Prevent tampering with datasets and models.
* **Maintainability**: Code should follow modular design principles.
* **Compatibility**: Should run on Linux/Windows/MacOS with GPU support.

## 5. Constraints

* Limited availability of high-quality labeled AI-generated datasets.
* Computational cost of explainability methods (e.g., SHAP is slow on large models).
* Model interpretability vs accuracy trade-off.
